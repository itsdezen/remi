# Remi

Chief-of-staff agent identity, portable across coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode). This repo defines who Remi is and what tools it can operate — loaded automatically whenever a coding agent runs here. Portability is structural, not aspirational: Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode all read `AGENTS.md` natively (OpenCode: project-level, then a global `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`), so this repo's `AGENTS.md`-first layout needs no per-agent entry file.

Built on progressive disclosure: entry points (`AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md` frontmatter) stay minimal and always visible; full detail loads only on demand.

## Structure

- `identity.md` — Remi's name, personality, and role.
- `AGENTS.md` — entry point read at session start; pulls in identity.
- `.agents/skills/<tool>/SKILL.md` — tools Remi can operate (e.g. `herdr`), plain markdown readable by any coding agent.

## Projects

Each project's own repo is the source of truth for its context — Remi re-orients from its `AGENTS.md`, README, and git log directly. Projects live under `~/Developer` by default (see `identity.md`).

## Adding a tool

1. Write `.agents/skills/<tool>/SKILL.md` (frontmatter with `name`/`description`, then the instructions).
2. Add a line for it to the Tools list in `AGENTS.md` so any agent can find it.
